This repo contains:

* Script for generating x86-64 assembler routines performing arithmetics on multi-limb integers,
along with the boilerplate necessary to use it from C and C++.
The focus is on simplicity, correctness and resistance to timing attacks.

* C++ code for in-field arithmetics.

# TODO

* Somewhat optimize assembly multiplication routines, if itâ€™s worth the trouble. Specifically, store
some intermediate results in the registers instead of adding them to the result in memory
immediately. Also, support for `mulx` (BMI2) and `adcx`/`adox` (ADX) would be nice to have.

* Implement a more efficient method of modular inversion; for example, implement algorithms from the
following papers:
 - [New Algorithm for Classical Modular Inverse](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F3-540-36400-5_6.pdf)
 - [Montgomery inversion](https://cetinkoc.net/docs/j82.pdf)
 - [The Montgomery Modular Inverse - Revisited](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.75.8377&rep=rep1&type=pdf)
